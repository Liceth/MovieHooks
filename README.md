## Introduction

This project will be able to search for movies via the OMDB API and render the results to the user. The reason for building the app is just so to get a better understanding of using hooks in an application, which helps in understanding the role some of the hooks we will use can play in your own real-world apps.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
